        <p><strong>General Information:</strong></p>
        <p> Welcome! This session is part of an experiment about decision making in economics.
            At the end of the session you will be paid, in private and in cash 5 Euros just for taking part plus an
            additional amount that will depend on your decisions and on the decisions of others. How this works will be
            explained in these instructions. Please read them carefully. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. </p>
            <br>
        <p> <strong>Teams:</strong> At the start of the experiment, you will be grouped with {{ nminus }} other individuals,
            randomly chosen from the people who are present today. Together you form a team of {{ n }}. Every team member
            receives an ID number from 1 to {{ n }}. You will remain in the same team throughout the entire experiment, and your
            ID number will also remain the same throughout.
            You will never be informed about the identities of the people behind other ID numbers. </p>
            <br>
        <p> <strong>Rounds:</strong> The experiment consists of nine rounds, all of which proceed in the same way.
            After round 3 and round 6, there will be some small changes.
            You will receive information about these changes at the appropriate time. </p>
            <br>
        <p> <strong>Payment:</strong> During the experiment, earnings will be denoted in ”points”. Each point is worth
            20 Cents. At the end of the experiment, ONE of the nine rounds will be chosen randomly.
            The result of this randomly chosen round will determine your payment in Euros. </p>
            <br>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-content" id="rounds">
        <p><strong>What happens in each round?</strong></p>
        <p>At the beginning of a round, you will receive an initial amount of 45 points, paid into your <strong>private account</strong>.
            During the round, you can choose to transfer points from your private account to the <strong>team account</strong>.
            Any points you choose not to transfer will remain in your private account. The situation is the same for your teammates. </p>
            <br>
        <p> You can imagine that you and your teammates are working on a team project. The team project will either fail or succeed.
            It succeeds if, by the end of the round, the members of your team have overall transferred at least {{ onethird }} points (in total)
            from their private accounts to the team account. If the project succeeds, each team member will receive a reward of 14
            points (regardless of how much each individual has contributed to the project). If the threshold of {{ onethird }} points is not reached,
            then the team project fails and no reward is paid. </p>
            <br>
        <p> Furthermore, a donation to the charity organization UNICEF will be made, and the amount donated will depend on how many
            points have been allocated to the team accounts. For each team, UNICEF receives a budget of {{ 2x }} points at the beginning
            of the round. However, by default, the computer is programmed to destroy all {{ 2x }} UNICEF points at the end of the round.
            But for every 1 point that you and your team members transfer to the team account, 2 points of UNICEF are protected and
            will not be destroyed by the computer. If your team account reaches the maximum total of {{ x }} points, UNICEF will keep its
            entire budget. </p>
            <br>
        <p> The payment for UNICEF follows the same rules as the payment for you:
            Only the randomly selected round will be relevant for the actual donation, and each point is worth 20 Cents.</p>

    <div class="tab-content" id="transfer">
        <p><strong>How to contribute points?</strong></p>
        <p> You and your teammates will take turns to decide how many points to transfer to the team account.
            Team Member 1 goes first, is followed by team member 2 and so on. If you are team member 1,
            the team account will start with a balance of 0 points. If you are one of the other team members you will
            see on your screen how many points have already been transferred to the team account. </p>
        <br>
        <p> When it is your turn, you will see a timer on the screen, and while the timer is running, you can transfer
            points to the team account by clicking on some buttons on your screen. There will be a "+1" button and a "+10" button.
            Every time you click on the "+1" button, 1 point will be transferred from your private account to the team account.
            Every time you click on the "+10" button, 10 points will be transferred from your private account to the team account.
            You will also see how many points are left in your private account. On the left hand side of the screen,
            you will see real-time information about the current total number of points in the team account.
            The computer will not allow you to run into a deficit for your private account.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Initially, the timer on your screen starts with a 30-second countdown. However, if you make a transfer during
            the last 10 seconds of the countdown, the available time will be extended and the timer starts again from 10 seconds.
            Subsequently, the timer will continue to refresh to 10 seconds as long as you make another transfer.
            The round will end either when you let the timer run out, or when you have reached the maximum total of {{ x }}
            points in the team account. (There also is a randomly determined maximum time limit for each round;
            should this time limit be reached then the computer will simply stop refreshing the timer even if you make another transfer.) </p>
